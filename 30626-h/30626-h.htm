<h2>THE BLUE JAY.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 81px;">
<img src="images/imgd.png" width="81" height="80" alt="D" title="" />
</div>
<p>URING about three-fourths
of the year the American
Jay is an extremely tame,
noisy and even obstrusive
bird in its habits. As the breeding
season approaches he suddenly becomes
silent, preparing the nest in the most
secluded parts of his native forests, and
exercising all his cunning to keep it
concealed. He is omniverous but is
especially fond of eggs and young
birds. The Jay may be regarded as
eminently injurious though in spring
he consumes a number of insects to
atone for his sins of stealing fruit and
berries in autumn. He is a professional
nest robber, and other birds are as
watchful of him as is a mother of her
babe. He glides through the foliage
of the trees so swiftly and noiselessly
that his presence is scarcely suspected
until he has committed some depredation.
The Robin is his most wary foe,
and when the Jay is found near his
nest will pursue him and drive him
from the neighborhood. He is as
brave as he is active, however, and
dashes boldly in pursuit of his more
plainly attired neighbors who venture
to intrude upon his domain.</p>

<p>The Jay has a curious antipathy
toward the owl, perching on trees
above it and keeping up a continual
screeching. Some years ago an Ohio
gentleman was presented with a magnificent
specimen of the horned owl,
which he kept for a time in a large tin
cage. In favorable weather the cage
was set out of doors, when it would
soon be surrounded by Jays, much in
the manner described of the Toucan,
and an incessant screeching followed,
to which the owl appeared indifferent.
They would venture near enough to
steal a portion of his food, the bars of
his cage being sufficiently wide apart
to admit them. On one occasion,
however, he caught the tail of a Jay
in his claws and left the tormentor
without his proud appendage.</p>

<p>The Jay remains with us throughout
the year. He is one of the wildest
of our birds, the shyest of man,
although seeing him most. He makes
no regular migrations at certain seasons,
but, unless disturbed, will live out
his life close to his favorite haunts.
His wings show him to be unfitted for
extended flight.</p>

<p>Jays are most easily discovered in
the morning about sunrise on the tops
of young live oaks. Their notes are
varied. Later in the day it is more
difficult to find them, as they are more
silent, and not so much on the tree
tops as among the bushes.</p>

<p>The Jays breed in woods, forests,
orchards, preferring old and very shady
trees, placing their nests in the center
against the body, or at the bifurcation
of large limbs. The nest is formed of
twigs and roots; the eggs are from
four to six.</p>

<h2>THE SWALLOW-TAILED INDIAN ROLLER.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 82px;">
<img src="images/imgs.png" width="82" height="80" alt="S" title="" />
</div>
<p>WALLOW-TAILED Indian
Rollers are natives of Northeastern
Africa and Senegambia,
and also the interior of
the Niger district. The bird is so
called from its way of occasionally
rolling or turning over in its flight,
somewhat after the fashion of a tumbler
pigeon. A traveller in describing
the habits of the Roller family, says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 12th of April I reached
Jericho alone, and remained there in
solitude for several days, during which
time I had many opportunities of
observing the grotesque habits of the
Roller. For several successive evenings,
great flocks of Rollers mustered
shortly before sunset on some dona
trees near the fountain, with all the
noise but without the decorum of
Rooks. After a volley of discordant
screams, from the sound of which it
derives its Arabic name of &ldquo;schurkrak,&rdquo;
a few birds would start from their
perches and commence overhead a
series of somersaults. In a moment or
two they would be followed by the
whole flock, and these gambols would
be repeated for a dozen times or more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everywhere it takes its perch on
some conspicuous branch or on the
top of a rock, where it can see and be
seen. The bare tops of the fig trees,
before they put forth their leaves, are
in the cultivated terraces, a particularly
favorite resort. In the barren Ghor I
have often watched it perched unconcernedly
on a knot of gravel or marl
in the plain, watching apparently for
the emergence of beetles from the sand.
Elsewhere I have not seen it settle on
the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like Europeans in the East, it can
make itself happy without chairs and
tables in the desert, but prefers a
comfortable easy chair when it is to be
found. Its nest I have seen in ruins,
in holes in rocks, in burrows, in steep
sand cliffs, but far more generally in
hollow trees. The colony in the Wady
Kelt used burrows excavated by themselves,
and many a hole did they relinquish,
owing to the difficulty of working
it. So cunningly were the nests
placed under a crumbling, treacherous
ledge, overhanging a chasm of
perhaps one or two hundred feet,
that we were completely foiled in our
siege. We obtained a nest of six eggs,
quite fresh, in a hollow tree in Bashan,
near Gadara, on the 6th of May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The total length of the Roller is
about twelve inches. The Swallow-tailed
Indian Roller, of which we present
a specimen, differs from the Europeon
Roller only in having the outer
tail feathers elongated to an extent of
several inches.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE RED HEADED WOODPECKER.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 79px;">
<img src="images/imgp.png" width="79" height="80" alt="P" title="" />
</div>
<p>ERHAPS no bird in North
America is more universally
known than the Red Headed Woodpecker.
He is found in all parts of the United
States and is sometimes called, for
short, by the significant name of Red Head.
His tri-colored plumage, red,
white and black, glossed with steel
blue, is so striking and characteristic,
and his predatory habits in the
orchards and cornfields, and fondness
for hovering along the fences, so very
notorious, that almost every child is
acquainted with the Red Headed
Woodpecker. In the immediate
neighborhood of large cities, where the
old timber is chiefly cut down, he is
not so frequently found. Wherever
there is a deadening, however, you
will find him, and in the dead tops
and limbs of high trees he makes his
home. Towards the mountains,
particularly in the vicinity of creeks
and rivers, these birds are extremely
numerous, especially in the latter end
of summer. It is interesting to hear
them rattling on the dead leaves of
trees or see them on the roadside
fences, where they flit from stake to
stake. We remember a tremendous
and quite alarming and afterwards
ludicrous rattling by one of them on
some loose tin roofing on a neighbor&#8217;s
house. This occurred so often that
the owner, to secure peace, had the
roof repaired.</p>

<p>They love the wild cherries, the earliest
and sweetest apples, for, as is said
of him, &ldquo;he is so excellent a connoisseur
in fruit, that whenever an apple or
pear is found broached by him, it is sure
to be among the ripest and best flavored.
When alarmed he seizes a capital one
by striking his open bill into it, and
bears it off to the woods.&rdquo; He eats
the rich, succulent, milky young corn
with voracity. He is of a gay and
frolicsome disposition, and half a
dozen of the fraternity are frequently
seen diving and vociferating around
the high dead limbs of some large
trees, pursuing and playing with each
other, and amusing the passerby with
their gambols. He is a comical fellow,
too, prying around at you from the
bole of a tree or from his nesting hole
therein.</p>

<p>Though a lover of fruit, he does
more good than injury. Insects are
his natural food, and form at least two
thirds of his subsistence. He devours
the destructive insects that penetrate
the bark and body of a tree to deposit
their eggs and larvae.</p>

<p>About the middle of May, he begins
to construct his nest, which is formed
in the body of large limbs of trees,
taking in no material but smoothing
it within to the proper shape and size.
The female lays six eggs, of a pure
white. The young appear about the
first of June. About the middle of
September the Red Heads begin to
migrate to warmer climates, travelling
at night time in an irregular way like
a disbanded army and stopping for
rest and food through the day.</p>

<p>The black snake is the deadly foe of
the Red Head, frequently entering his
nest, feeding upon the young, and
remaining for days in possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The eager school-boy, after hazarding
his neck to reach the Woodpecker&#8217;s
hole, at the triumphant
moment when he thinks the nestlings
his own, strips his arm, launches
it down into the cavity, and grasping
what he conceives to be the callow
young, starts with horror at the sight
of a hideous snake, almost drops from
his giddy pinnacle, and retreats down
the tree with terror and precipitation.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE WOODPECKER.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>The Drummer Bird.</strong></p>


<p>My dear girls and boys:</p>

<p>The man who told me to keep
still and look pleasant while he
took my picture said I might
write you a letter to send with
it. You say I always keep on
the other side of the tree from
you. That is because someone
has told you that I spoil trees,
and I am afraid that you will
want to punish me for it. I do
not spoil trees. The trees like
to have me come to visit them,
for I eat the insects that are
killing them. Shall I tell you
how I do this?</p>

<p>I cling to the tree with my
strong claws so sharply hooked.
The pointed feathers of my tail
are stiff enough to help hold me
against the bark. Then my
breast bone is quite flat, so that
I may press close to the tree.
When I am all ready you hear
my r-r-rap&mdash;just like a rattle.
My head goes as quickly as if it
were moved by a spring. Such
a strong, sharp bill makes the
chips fly! The tiny tunnel I dig
just reaches the insect.</p>

<p>Then I thrust out my long
tongue. It has a sharp, horny
tip, and has barbs on it too.
Very tiny insects stick to a liquid
like glue that covers my tongue.
I suppose I must tell you that I
like a taste of the ripest fruit
and grain. Don&#8217;t you think I
earn a little when I work so
hard keeping the trees healthy?</p>

<p>I must tell you about the deep
tunnel my mate and I cut out of
a tree. It is just wide enough
for us to slip into. It is not
straight down, but bent, so that
the rain cannot get to the bottom.
There we make a nest of
little chips for our five white
eggs.</p>

<p>I should like to tell you one
of the stories that some boys
and girls tell about my red head.
You will find it on another page
of the book. Now I must fly
away to peck for more bugs.</p>

<h2>MEXICAN MOT MOT.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 115px;">
<img src="images/imgm.png" width="115" height="80" alt="M" title="" />
</div>
<p>OT MOTS are peculiar to
the new world, being
found from Mexico
throughout the whole
of Central America and the South
American continent. The general
plumage is green, and the majority of
the species have a large racket at the
end of the center tail feathers, formed
by the bird itself.</p>

<p>The Houton, (so called from his
note,) according to Waterson, ranks
high in beauty among the birds of
Demerara. This beautiful creature
seems to suppose that its beauty can
be increased by trimming its tail,
which undergoes the same operation
as one&#8217;s hair in a barber shop, using
its own beak, which is serrated, in lieu
of a pair of scissors. As soon as its
tail is fully grown, he begins about
an inch from the extremity of the two
longest feathers in it and cuts away
the web on both sides of the shaft,
making a gap about an inch long.
Both male and female wear their tails
in this manner, which gives them a
remarkable appearance among all other
birds.</p>

<p>To observe this bird in his native
haunts, one must be in the forest at
dawn. He shuns the society of man.
The thick and gloomy forests are preferred
by the Houton. In those far
extending wilds, about day-break, you
hear him call in distinct and melancholy
tone, &ldquo;Houton, Houton!&rdquo; An
observer says, &ldquo;Move cautiously to the
place from which the sound proceeds,
and you will see him sitting in the
underwood, about a couple of yards
from the ground, his tail moving up
and down every time he articulates &ldquo;Houton!&rdquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mot Mot lives on insects and
berries found among the underwood,
and very rarely is seen in the lofty
trees. He makes no nest, but rears
his young in a hole in the sand, generally
on the side of a hill.</p>

<p>Mr. Osbert Salvin tells this curious
anecdote: &ldquo;Some years ago the Zoological
Society possessed a specimen
which lived in one of the large cages
of the parrot house by itself. I have
a very distinct recollection of the bird,
for I used every time I saw it to cheer
it up a bit by whistling such of its
notes as I had picked up in the forests
of America. The bird always seemed
to appreciate this attention, for
although it never replied, it became at
once animated, hopped about the cage,
and swung its tail from side to side
like the pendulum of a clock. For a
long time its tail had perfect spatules,
but toward the end of its life I noticed
that the median feathers were no longer
trimmed with such precision, and on
looking at its beak I noticed that from
some cause or other it did not close
properly, gaped slightly at the tip, and
had thus become unfitted for removing
the vanes of the feathers.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>KING PARROT OR KING LORY.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/imgl.png" width="100" height="80" alt="L" title="" />
</div>
<p>ORY is the name of certain
birds, mostly from the Moluccas
and New Guinea, which
are remarkable for their
bright scarlet or crimson coloring,
though also applied to some others in
which the plumage is chiefly green.
Much interest has been excited by the
discovery of Dr. A. B. Meyer that the
birds of this genus having a red
plumage are the females of those wearing
green feathers. For a time there
was much difference of opinion on
this subject, but the assertion is now
generally admitted.</p>

<p>They are called &ldquo;brush-tongued&rdquo;
Parrots. The color of the first plumage
of the young is still unsettled. This
bird is a favorite among bird fanciers,
is readily tamed, and is of an affectionate
nature. It can be taught to
speak very creditably, and is very fond
of attracting the attention of strangers
and receiving the caresses of those
whom it likes.</p>

<p>There are few things a parrot prefers
to nuts and the stones of various
fruits. Wood says he once succeeded
in obtaining the affections of a Parisian
Parrot, solely through the medium of
peach stones which he always saved
for the bird and for which it regularly
began to gabble as soon as it saw him
coming. &ldquo;When taken freshly from
the peach,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the stones are
very acceptable to the parrot, who
turns them over, chuckling all the
while to show his satisfaction, and
picking all the soft parts from the deep
indentations in the stone.&rdquo; He used
to crack the stone before giving it to
the bird, when his delight knew no
bounds. They are fond of hot condiments,
cayenne pepper or the capsicum
pod. If a bird be ailing, a capsicum
will often set it right again.</p>

<p>The parrot is one of the hardiest of
birds when well cared for and will live
to a great age. Some of these birds
have been known to attain an age of
seventy years, and one seen by Vaillant
had reached the patriarchal age of
ninety three. At sixty its memory
began to fail, at sixty-five the moult
became very irregular and the tail
changed to yellow. At ninety it was
a very decrepit creature, almost blind
and quite silent, having forgotten its
former abundant stock of words.</p>

<p>A gentleman once had for many
years a parrot of seemingly rare
intelligence. It was his custom during
the summer to hang the parrot&#8217;s cage in
front of his shop in a country village,
where the bird would talk and laugh
and cry, and condole with itself. Dogs
were his special aversion and on occasions
when he had food to spare, he
would drop it out of the cage and
whistle long and loud for them. When
the dogs had assembled to his satisfaction
he would suddenly scream in the
fiercest accents, &ldquo;Get out, dogs!&rdquo; and
when they had scattered in alarm his
enjoyment of it was demonstrative.
This parrot&#8217;s vocabulary, however,
was not the most refined, his master
having equipped him with certain
piratical idioms.</p>

<p>According to authority, the parrot
owner will find the health of his pet
improved and its happiness promoted
by giving it, every now and then, a
small log or branch on which the
mosses and lichens are still growing.
Meat, fish, and other similar articles of
diet are given with evil effects.</p>

<p>It is impossible for anyone who has
only seen these birds in a cage or small
inclosure to conceive what must be the
gorgeous appearance of a flock, either
in full flight, and performing their
various evolutions, under a vertical
sun, or sporting among the superb
foliage of a tropical forest which,
without these, and other brilliant
tenants, would present only a solitude
of luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN ROBIN.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>The Bird of the Morning.</strong></p>


<p>Yes, my dear readers, I am the
bird of the morning. Very few
of you rise early enough to hear
my first song. By the time you
are awake our little ones have
had their breakfast, Mrs. Robin
and I have had our morning bath
and we are all ready to greet
you with our morning song.</p>

<p>I wonder if any of you have
seen our nest and can tell the
color of the eggs that Mrs. Robin
lays. Some time I will let you
peep into the nest and see them,
but of course you will not touch
them.</p>

<p>I wonder, too, if you know any
of my cousins&mdash;the Mocking
bird, the Cat-bird or the Brown
Thrush&mdash;I think I shall ask
them to have their pictures taken
soon and talk to you about our
gay times.</p>

<p>Did you ever see one of my
cousins on the ground? I don&#8217;t
believe you can tell how I move
about. Some of you may say I
run, and some of you may say I
hop, and others of you may say
I do both. Well, I&#8217;ll tell you
how to find out. Just watch me
and see. My little friends up
north won&#8217;t be able to see me
though until next month, as I do
not dare leave the warm south
until Jack Frost leaves the
ground so I can find worms to
eat.</p>

<p>I shall be about the first bird
to visit you next month and I
want you to watch for me.
When I do come it will be to
stay a long time, for I shall be
the last to leave you. Just
think, the first to come and last
to leave. Don&#8217;t you think we
ought to be great friends? Let
us get better acquainted when
next we meet. Your friend,<br />

<h2>THE AMERICAN ROBIN.</h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;Come, sweetest of the feathered throng.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 64px;">
<img src="images/imgo.png" width="64" height="80" alt="O" title="" />
</div>
<p>UR American Robin must
not be confounded with the
English Robin Redbreast,
although both bear the same
name. It is the latter bird in whose
praise so much has been written in fable
and song. The American Robin belongs
to the Thrush family; the Mocking
bird, Cat-bird and Brown Thrush, or
Thrasher, being other familiar children.
In this family, bird organization
reaches its highest development. This
bird is larger than his English cousin
the Redbreast and many think has a
finer note than any other of the Thrush
family.</p>

<p>The Robin courts the society of man,
following close upon the plow and the
spade and often becoming quite tame
and domestic. It feeds for a month or
two on strawberries and cherries, but
generally on worms and insects picked
out of the ground. It destroys the
larvae of many insects in the soil and
is a positive blessing to man, designed
by the Creator for ornament and
pleasure, and use in protecting
vegetation. John Burroughs, the bird lover,
says it is the most native and democratic
of our birds.</p>

<p>It is widely diffused over the country,
migrating to milder climates in the
Winter. We have heard him in the
early dawn on Nantucket Island welcoming
the coming day, in the valleys
of the Great and the little Miami, in
the parks of Chicago, and on the plains
of Kansas, his song ever cheering and
friendly. It is one of the earliest heralds
of Spring, coming as early as
March or April, and is one of the latest
birds to leave us in Autumn. Its
song is a welcome prelude to the general
concert of Summer.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
&ldquo;When Robin Redbreast sings,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">We think on budding Springs.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The Robin is not one of our most
charming songsters, yet its carol is
sweet, hearty and melodious. Its principal
song is in the morning before
sunrise, when it mounts the top of
some tall tree, and with its wonderful
power of song, announces the coming
of day. When educated, it imitates
the sounds of various birds, and even
sings tunes. It must be amusing to
hear it pipe out so solemn a strain as
Old Hundred.</p>

<p>It has no remarkable habits. It
shows considerable courage and
anxiety for its young, and is a pattern
of propriety when keeping house and
concerned with the care of its offspring.
Two broods are often reared
out of the same nest. In the Fall
these birds become restless and
wandering, often congregating in large
flocks, when, being quite fat, they are
much esteemed as food.</p>

<p>The Robin&#8217;s nest is sometimes built
in a corner of the porch, but oftener it
is saddled on the horizontal limb of
an orchard tree. It is so large and
poorly concealed that any boy can
find it, yet it is seldom molested. The
Robin is not a skillful architect. The
masonry of its nest is rough and the
material coarse, being composed
largely of leaves or old grass, cemented
with mud. The eggs number four to
six and are greenish blue in color.</p>

<p>An observer tells the following story
of this domestic favorite:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the last three years a Robin
has nested on a projecting pillar that
supports the front piazza. In the
Spring of the first year she built her
nest on the top of the pillar&mdash;a rude
affair&mdash;it was probably her first effort.
The same season she made her second
nest in the forks of an Oak, which
took her only a few hours to complete.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>THE AMERICAN ROBIN.</strong></p>
<p>[continued]</p>

<p>&ldquo;She reared three broods that season;
for the third family she returned to
the piazza, and repaired the first nest.
The following Spring she came again
to the piazza, but selected another
pillar for the site of her domicile, the
construction of which was a decided
improvement upon the first. For the
next nest she returned to the Oak and
raised a second story on the old one of
the previous year, but making it much
more symmetrical than the one beneath.
The present season her first dwelling
was as before, erected on a pillar of
the piazza&mdash;as fine a structure as I
ever saw this species build. When
this brood was fledged she again
repaired to the Oak, and reared a
third story on the old domicile, using
the moss before mentioned, making a
very elaborate affair, and finally
finishing up by festooning it with long
sprays of moss. This bird and her
mate were quite tame. I fed them
with whortleberries, which they
seemed to relish, and they would come
almost to my feet to get them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The amount of food which the
young robin is capable of absorbing is
enormous. A couple of vigorous,
half-grown birds have been fed, and
in twelve hours devoured ravenously,
sixty-eight earth worms, weighing
thirty-four pennyweight, or forty-one
per cent more than their own weight.
A man at this rate should eat about
seventy pounds of flesh per day, and
drink five or six gallons of water.</p>

<p>The following poem by the good
Quaker poet Whittier is sweet because
<em>he</em> wrote it, interesting because it
recites an old legend which incidentally
explains the color of the robin&#8217;s breast,
and unique because it is one of the
few poems about our American bird.</p>

<h2>THE KINGFISHER.</h2>


<p>Dear Children:</p>

<p>I shall soon arrive from the
south. I hear that all the birds
are going to tell stories to the
boys and girls.</p>

<p>I have never talked much with
children myself for I never really
cared for people. They used to
say that the dead body of a
Kingfisher kept them safe in
war and they said also that it
protected them in lightning.</p>

<p>Even now in some places in
France they call us the moth
birds, for they believe that our
bodies will keep away moths
from woolen cloth.</p>

<p>I wish that people would not
believe such things about us.
Perhaps you cannot understand
me when I talk. You may think
that you hear only a child&#8217;s
rattle.</p>

<p>Listen again! It is I, the
Kingfisher. That sound is my
way of talking. I live in the
deep woods. I own a beautiful
stream and a clear, cool lake.
Oh, the little fish in that lake
are good enough for a king
to eat! I know, for I am a king.</p>

<p>You may see me or some of
my mates near the lake any
pleasant day. People used to
say that we always brought
pleasant weather. That is a
joke. It is the pleasant weather
that always brings us from our
homes. When it storms or rains
we cannot see the fish in the lake.
Then we may as well stay in our nests.</p>

<p>My home once belonged to a
water rat. He dug the fine hall
in the gravel bank in my stream.
It is nearly six feet long. The
end of it is just the kind of a
place for a nest. It is warm,
dry and dark. In June my wife
and I will settle down in it. By
that time we shall have the nest
well lined with fish bones. We
shall put in some dried grass too.
The fish bones make a fine lining
for a nest. You know we
swallow the fish whole, but we
save all the bones for our nest.</p>

<p>I shall help my wife hatch her
five white eggs and shall try in
every way to make my family safe.</p>

<p>Please tell the people not to
believe those strange things
about me and you will greatly
oblige,<br />

<h2>THE KINGFISHER.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>The Lone Fisherman.</strong></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/imgt.png" width="86" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<p>HE American species belongs
to the true group of Kingfishers.
It occupies the whole
continent of North America
and although migrating in the north,
he is a constant resident of our southern
states. The belted Kingfisher is
the only variety found along the
inland streams of the United States.
Audubon declares that &ldquo;belted&rdquo; should
apply only to the female, however.</p>

<p>Like most birds of brilliant plumage,
the Kingfisher prefers a quiet and
secluded haunt. It loves the little
trout streams, with wooded and precipitous
banks, the still ponds and
small lakes, ornamental waters in
parks, where it is not molested, and
the sides of sluggish rivers, drains and
mill-ponds.</p>

<p>Here in such a haunt the bird often
flits past like an indistinct gleam of
bluish light. Fortune may sometimes
favor the observer and the bird may
alight on some twig over the stream,
its weight causing it to sway gently to
and fro. It eagerly scans the shoal of
young trout sporting in the pool below,
when suddenly it drops down into the
water, and, almost before the observer
is aware of the fact, is back again to
its perch with a struggling fish in its
beak. A few blows on the branch and
its prey is ready for the dexterous
movement of the bill, which places it
in a position for swallowing. Sometimes
the captured fish is adroitly
jerked into the air and caught as it
falls.</p>

<p>Fish is the principal food of the
Kingfisher; but it also eats various
kinds of insects, shrimps, and even
small crabs. It rears its young in a
hole, which is made in the banks of
the stream it frequents. It is a slatternly
bird, fouls its own nest and its
peerless eggs. The nesting hole is
bored rather slowly, and takes from
one to two weeks to complete. Six or
eight white glossy eggs are laid, sometimes
on the bare soil, but often on the
fish bones which, being indigestible,
are thrown up by the bird in pellets.</p>

<p>The Kingfisher has a crest of feathers
on the top of his head, which he
raises and lowers, especially when trying
to drive intruders away from his nest.</p>

<p>The plumage is compact and oily,
making it almost impervious to water.
The flesh is fishy and disagreeable to the
taste, but the eggs are said to be good
eating. The wings are long and
pointed and the bill longer than the
head. The voice is harsh and monotonous.</p>

<p>It is said that few birds are connected
with more fables than the Kingfisher.
The superstition that a dead
Kingfisher when suspended by the
throat, would turn its beak to that
particular point of the compass from
which the wind blew, is now dead.
It was also supposed to possess many
astonishing virtues, as that its dried
body would avert thunderbolts, and
if kept in a wardrobe would preserve
from moths the woolen stuffs and the
like contained in it.</p>

<p>Under the name of &ldquo;halcyon,&rdquo; it
was fabled by the ancients to build its
nest on the surface of the sea, and to
have the power of calming the troubled
waves during its period of incubation;
hence the phrase &ldquo;halcyon days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A pair of Kingfishers have had their
residence in a bank at the south end
of Washington Park, Chicago, for at
least three seasons past. We have
watched the Kingfisher from secluded
spots on Long Island ponds and tidal
streams, where his peculiar laughing
note is the same as that which greets
the ear of the fisherman on far inland
streams on still summer days.</p>

Wales. It is one of the handsomest,
not only of the Australian
Parrots, but takes foremost
place among the most gorgeously
dressed members of the Parrot
family that are to be met with in any
part of the world. It is about eleven
or twelve inches in length. The
female cannot with certainty be distinguished
from her mate, but is usually
a very little smaller. The Lory seldom
descends to the ground, but passes
the greater part of its life among the
gum trees upon the pollen and nectar
on which it mainly subsists. In times
of scarcity, however, it will also eat
grass seeds, as well as insects, for want
of which it is said, it often dies prematurely
when in captivity.</p>

<p>Dr. Russ mentions that a pair obtained
from a London dealer in 1870
for fifty dollars were the first of these
birds imported, but the London Zoological
Society had secured some of
them two years before.</p>

<p>Despite his beauty, the Blue Mountain
Lory is not a desirable bird to
keep, as he requires great care. A
female which survived six years in an
aviary, laying several eggs, though
kept singly, was fed on canary seed,
maize, a little sugar, raw beef and carrots.
W. Gedney seems to have been
peculiarly happy in his specimens,
remarking, &ldquo;But for the terribly sudden
death which so often overtakes
these birds, they would be the most
charming feathered pets that a lady
could possess, having neither the power
nor inclination to bite savagely.&rdquo; The
same writer&#8217;s recommendation to feed
this Lory exclusively upon soft food,
in which honey forms a great part,
probably accounts for his advice to
those &ldquo;whose susceptible natures would
be shocked&rdquo; by the sudden death of
their favorite, not to become the owner
of a Blue Mountain Lory.</p>

<p>Like all the parrot family these
Lories breed in hollow boughs, where
the female deposits from three to four
white eggs, upon which she sits for
twenty-one days. The young from
the first resemble their parents closely,
but are a trifle less brilliantly colored.</p>

<p>They are very active and graceful,
but have an abominable shriek. The
noise is said to be nearly as disagreeable
as the plumage is beautiful. They
are very quarrelsome and have to be
kept apart from the other parrots, which
they will kill. Other species of birds
however, are not disturbed by them.
It is a sort of family animosity. They
have been bred in captivity.</p>

<p>The feathers of the head and neck
are long and very narrow and lie
closely together; the claws are strong
and hooked, indicating their tree
climbing habits. Their incessant activity
and amusing ways make these birds
always interesting to watch.</p>

<p>HE much abused and persecuted
Red Wing Black Bird is found
throughout North America,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific;
and it breeds more or less abundantly
wherever found. In New England
it is generally migratory, though
instances are on record where a few
have been known to remain throughout
the winter in Massachusetts. Passing,
in January, through the lower
counties of Virginia, one frequently
witnesses the aerial evolutions of great
numbers of these birds. Sometimes
they appear as if driven about like an
enormous black cloud carried before
the wind, varying every moment in
shape. Sometimes they rise suddenly
from the fields with a noise like thunder,
while the glittering of innumerable
wings of the brightest vermillion,
amid the black cloud, occasion a very
striking effect. At times the whole
congregated multitude will suddenly
alight in some detached grove and
commence one general concert, that
can plainly be distinguished at the
distance of more than two miles. With
the Redwings the whole winter season
seems one continued carnival. They
find abundant food in the old fields of
rice, buckwheat and grain, and much
of their time is spent in aerial movements,
or in grand vocal performances.</p>

<p>The Redwings, for their nest, always
select either the borders of streams or
low marshy situations, amongst thick
bunches of reeds. One nest was found
built on a slender sapling at the distance
of fourteen feet from the ground.
The nest was pensile, like that of the
Baltimore Oriole.</p>

<p>They have from one to three or more
broods in a season, according to
locality.</p>

<p>In the grain growing states they
gather in immense swarms and commit
havoc, and although they are shot
in great numbers, and though their
ranks are thinned by the attacks of
hawks, it seems to have but little
effect upon the survivors.</p>

<p>On the other hand, these Black
Birds more than compensate the farmer
for their mischief by the benefit they
confer in the destruction of grub
worms, caterpillars, and various kinds
of larvae, the secret and deadly enemies
of vegetation. It has been estimated
the number of insects destroyed by
these birds in a single season, in the
United States, to be twelve thousand
millions.</p>

<p>The eggs average about an inch in
length. They are oval in shape, have
a light bluish ground, and are marbled,
lined and blotched with markings of
light and dark purple and black.</p>

<h2>THE BIRD OF SOCIETY.</h2>


<p>The blackbird loves to be one
of a great flock. He talks, sings
or scolds from morning until
night. He cannot keep still. He
will only stay alone with his
family a few months in the summer.
That is the reason he is
called the &ldquo;Bird of Society.&rdquo;
When he is merry, he gaily
sings, &ldquo;Conk-quer-ree.&rdquo; When
he is angry or frightened he
screams, &ldquo;Chock! Chock!&rdquo;
When he is flying or bathing he
gives a sweet note which sounds
like ee-u-u. He can chirp&mdash;chick,
check, chuck, to his little
ones as softly as any other bird.
But only his best friends ever
hear his sweetest tones, for the
Blackbirds do not know how to
be polite. They all talk at once.
That is why most people think
they only scream and chatter.
Did you ever hear the blackbirds
in the cornfields? If the
farmers thought about it perhaps
they would feel that part
of every corn crop belongs to the
Blackbirds. When the corn is
young, the farmer cannot see the
grubs which are eating the young
plants. The Blackbirds can.
They feed them to their babies&mdash;many
thousands in a day.
That is the way the crops are
saved for the farmer. But he
never thinks of that. Later when
the Blackbirds come for their
share of the corn the farmer
says, &ldquo;No, they shall not have
my corn. I must stop that
quickly.&rdquo; Perhaps the Blackbirds
said the same thing to
the grubs in the spring. It is
hard to have justice for everyone.</p>

<p>In April the Blackbird and his
mate leave the noisy company.
They seek a cosy home near the
water where they can be quiet
until August. They usually
choose a swampy place among
low shrubs and rushes. Here
in the deep nest of coarse grass,
moss and mud the mother bird
lays her five eggs. They are
very pretty&mdash;light blue with purple
and black markings. Their
friends say this is the best time
to watch the blackbirds. In the
flock they are all so much alike
we cannot tell one from another.
You would like to hear of some
of the wise things Blackbirds
do when they are tame.</p>

<p>One friend of the birds turned
her home into a great open bird
cage. Her chair was the favorite
perch of her birds. She
never kept them one minute
longer than they wanted to stay.
Yet her home was always full.
This was Olive Thorne Miller.
If you care to, you might ask
mother to get &ldquo;Bird Ways&rdquo; and
read you what she says about
this &ldquo;bird of society&rdquo; and the
other birds of this book.</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN RED BIRD.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 93px;">
<img src="images/imga1.png" width="93" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div>
<p>MERICAN RED BIRDS are
among our most common
cage birds, and are very generally
known in Europe,
numbers of them having
been carried over both to France and
England. Their notes are varied and
musical; many of them resembling the
high notes of a fife, and are nearly as
loud. They are in song from March
to September, beginning at the first
appearance of dawn and repeating
successively twenty or thirty times,
and with little intermission, a favorite
strain.</p>

<p>The sprightly figure and gaudy
plumage of the Red Bird, his vivacity,
strength of voice, and actual variety of
note, and the little expense with which
he is kept, will always make him a
favorite.</p>

<p>This species is more numerous to
the east of the great range of the Alleghenies,
but is found in Pennsylvania
and Ohio, and is numerous in the
lower parts of the Southern States. In
January and February they have been
found along the roadsides and fences,
hovering together in half dozens,
associating with snow birds, and various
kinds of sparrows. In the northern
states they are migratory, and in
the southern part of Pennsylvania they
reside during the whole year, frequenting
the borders of rivulets, in sheltered
hollows, covered with holly, laurel,
and other evergreens. They love also
to reside in the vicinity of fields of
Indian corn, a grain that constitutes
their chief and favorite food. The
seeds of apples, cherries, and other
fruit are also eaten by them, and they
are accused of destroying bees.</p>

<p>Early in May the Red Bird begins to
prepare his nest, which is very often
fixed in a holly, cedar or laurel bush. A
pair of Red Birds in Ohio returned for a
number of years to build their nest in
a honeysuckle vine under a portico.
They were never disturbed and never
failed to rear a brood of young. The
nest was constructed of small twigs,
dry weeds, slips of vine bark, and lined
with stalks of fine grass. Four eggs
of brownish olive were laid, and they
usually raised two broods in a season.</p>

<p>In confinement they fade in color,
but if well cared for, will live to a
considerable age. They are generally
known by the names: Red Bird, Virginia
Red Bird, Virginia Nightingale,
and Crested Red Bird. It is said that
the female often sings nearly as well
as the male.</p>
